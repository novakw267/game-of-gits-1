House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent. He made it through a long journey and no one cares because everyone knew Sean Bean would die. If you didn't see that coming, you don't know who Sean Bean is, I swear its in his contracts.
